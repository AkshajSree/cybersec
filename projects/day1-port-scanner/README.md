# Day 1 Project â€“ Simple Port Scanner

### Goal
Scan a safe host (`scanme.nmap.org`) for a few common TCP ports.

### Steps
1. Wrote a Python script using the `socket` module.
2. Scanned these ports: 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143, 443.

### Sample Run

### Learning
- Understood how TCP ports work.
- Practised basic Python networking.
- Learned to save scan output in `scan-results.txt`.
